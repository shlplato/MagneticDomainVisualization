#[Magnetic Domain Visualization](http://52.27.90.205/MagneticDomainVisualization.html)

This is a project I created for a colleague working in education.

The visualization is designed to illustrate to students the behavior of ferromagnetic
materials at the nano scale. It utilizes pure javascript and HTML5 to dynamically draw
and update the model.

Various parameters such as color, font, label text, etc can be configured by editing the
file ./js/config/user-config.

To build it yourself, run:

    npm install
    npm run build
